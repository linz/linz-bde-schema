COMMENT ON TABLE bde.crs_coordinate IS $DESC$
A set of numbers which define the position of a node relative to a coordinate system.

Coordinates are either system derived or obtained from an authoritative source.  The form of the coordinates (polar, Cartesian, etc.) depends on the Coordinate Type assigned to a coordinate system. Coordinates of nodes are usually derived from a network adjustment of reduced survey observations. The authoritative coordinate values of a node or mark will update from time to time as new survey data is received and incorporated into the system. Coordinates can be transformed, to be held in different coordinate systems, or adjusted to represent an improvement in the positional accuracy of a node.

COMMENT ON TABLE bde.crs_coordinate_sys IS $DESC$
An associate entity that resolves the many-to - many relationships between Datum and Coordinate Type.

Coordinates are expressed in terms of a Coordinate System. For example, Coordinates may be expressed as latitude and longitude (a Coordinate Type) on New Zealand Geodetic Datum 1949 (a Datum). Transformations operate between Coordinate Systems. For example, a transformation may relate Cartesian Coordinates on NZGD49 to Cartesian Coordinates on WGS84.

https://data.linz.govt.nz/table/1710
$DESC$;

COMMENT ON TABLE bde.crs_datum IS $DESC$
A Datum is a complete system for enabling Coordinates to be assigned to Nodes.

A datum is prescribed by the appropriate authority from which it derives its validity. All Coordinates will be in terms of a Datum. A Datum also provides a spatial standard for the alignment of Reduced Observations via a Datum Calibration.  Most Reduced Observations are Datum dependent but there are specific Reduced Observation types which are Datum independent. The Datum entity contains information about the official geodetic Datum used in Land Information NZ databases and other important Datum’s used to spatially reference source data (e.g.. Reduced Observations) or output data or products (e.g.. Coordinates, Digital Cadastral Database, topographic maps, hydrographic charts, etc). The Datum entity includes objects which, strictly, are reference frames rather than datum’s but the distinction is a fine technical point which is of no great consequence. The Datum entity includes vertical reference surfaces such as leveling datum’s, various tidal surfaces including Mean Sea Level, the geoid, datum ellipsoids, etc. For a Datum to maintain accuracy over a significant area it must be geodetic. Examples of non-geodetic datum’s are the Old Cadastral Datum’s. These do not account for the curvature of the earth and therefore can only maintain accuracy over a limited part of the earthʼs surface.

If the line sequence is a ring (as specified in PRI), the start and end nodes of the sequence must be the same, after the reverse flag has been applied to all lines in the sequence. Not all line sequences for a parcel ring are actually rings, however, as in the case of easement and walkway centreline parcels (i.e. parcels with a topology class of type "LINE"). For polygonal parcels (i.e. rings), the area occupied by the parcel must be on the right-hand side of the boundary at all times; this means that exterior rings will be defined in a clockwise direction (as specified by the coordinates of the nodes/vertices of the lines after reverse flag is applied), whereas interior rings will be defined in an anti-clockwise direction.

COMMENT ON TABLE bde.CRS_TOPOLOGY_CLASS IS $DESC$
[Survey Config] This entity stores the available topology classes.
$DESC$;

COMMENT ON TABLE bde.CRS_IMAGE IS $DESC$
[Common] This entity stores a reference all of the image documents stored within the system.
$DESC$;

COMMENT ON TABLE bde.CRS_VERTX_SEQUENCE IS $DESC$
[Survey] This entity defines the order of points used to construct an irregular line.
$DESC$;

COMMENT ON TABLE bde.CRS_GEODETIC_NODE_NETWORK IS $DESC$
[Survey] Nodes associated with geodetic network.
$DESC$;

COMMENT ON TABLE bde.CRS_NETWORK_PLAN IS $DESC$
[Survey Config] This entity holds information about the graphic view of the proposed design for the various orders of the new Geodetic Datum 2000.  Each Network Plan will be defined as a polygon (see Network Area) and will be produced as a graphic view.  This information is utilized in the definition of the Programme and for the validation of contracted Network schemes.  The graphical representation of these plans will be held as a layer in the spatial component of CRS.
$DESC$;

COMMENT ON TABLE bde.CRS_PROGRAMME IS $DESC$
An annual administrative grouping of contracts, which has been defined
as part of the Geodetic System business plan in association with the
Regional Chief Surveyors and the Surveyor General.

The information held here will relate to the actual contracts, their
monitoring and status and the status of the programme progress.
It will also have links to other business systems such as finance.
Components of this programme will be defined by the Networks plans.
The programme also includes the internal work done by the geodetic staff.
$DESC$;

COMMENT ON TABLE bde.CRS_SURVEY_IMAGE IS $DESC$
[Survey] This entity stores the link between surveys and the images of
plans (as generated from plangen).
$DESC$;

COMMENT ON TABLE bde.CRS_ORDINATE_ADJ IS $DESC$
[Survey] Coordinate Adjustment allows for the identification of the
initial Coordinates used as input to an Adjustment or which were output
from a network Adjustment.  It may also contain quality information
specific to that Coordinate and that Network Adjustment.
$DESC$;

COMMENT ON TABLE bde.CRS_FEATURE_NAME IS $DESC$
[Common] This entity stores all of the names associated with features.
$DESC$;

COMMENT ON TABLE bde.CRS_IMAGE_HISTORY IS $DESC$
[Common] Allows an updated image stored in Centera to be stored,
without losing the prior Centera reference. For example - if a document
is rescanned with better quality settings, the new scan is stored to
Centera and the crs_image row updated with the newly allocated Centera id
(so Landonline now displays the updated scan). This table will then hold
two rows relating to the document image - a row with the Centera id of
the original scan and a row with the Centera id of the updated scan.
$DESC$;

COMMENT ON TABLE bde.CRS_ADJ_OBS_CHANGE IS $DESC$
[Survey] This entity is used to define the observations to be used within
an adjustment and associated inout information.  After the adjustment
has been performed it store changes to observations that will become
effective after the adjustment has been authorised and details about
the quality of the observation.
$DESC$;

COMMENT ON TABLE bde.CRS_GEODETIC_NETWORK IS $DESC$
